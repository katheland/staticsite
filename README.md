# staticsite
A static site generation tool.  A project for Boot.dev

For the current output, see [Github Pages](https://katheland.github.io/staticsite/)

# How to use
Put markdown files in the content folder and static content like css files and images in the static folder.  Then run main.sh.

# Ideas for the Future
- Bold and italic at the same time.
- I should look into markdown further, see if there are more features I can implement.
- (Underline!  Strikethrough!  The dreaded Blink!  Probably not that last one, it may not still be supported...)
